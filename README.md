# Pac-Man

### Notes:
##### This is the first large-scale program that I produced. 
##### It is not very code efficient as it was created before I became familiar with Object-Oriented Programming. 
##### Much like the original game, the ghosts have three modes that they shift through: <br/> Chase (trail Pac-Man), Scatter (move to respective corners), and Frightened (escape Pac-Man).
##### That being said, here are some images of the screen layouts and a demo video:

Note that there is an option to pause the game (this was not explored in the demo video).
